# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification


The code provided in this repository demonstrates the implementation of two classification models: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression. The models are trained on the WDBC dataset, which contains various features derived from digitized images of breast mass.

The program follows the following steps:
1. Loading the WDBC dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Preprocessing the data by splitting it into features (X) and the target variable (y).
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. Building and training the SVM model.
5. Building and training the logistic regression model.
6. Evaluating both models using accuracy score and classification report on the test set.
